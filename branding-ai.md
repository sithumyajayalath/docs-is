This transformation is dealing with a minor grammatical issue with the documenting of Branding AI.

The sentence now reads:
With the help of AI Branding, one can ensure that the provided pages that will be triggered by users will not only appear beautiful, but will also be perfectly fitting to the image of your brand.

These changes increase accuracy and professional attitude to the record.
